store input into a seperated array
that splits the alphabet into different
elements in that array.

using that array we can then move onto
the shift based off of the polarity
of the number presented

if(shift isnt present, =0, <-25 || > 25)
return false;

keeps the spaces as inputted

toLowerCase() input

wrap the letter if its at A or Z
